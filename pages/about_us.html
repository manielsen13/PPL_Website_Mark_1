        <div class="headerExtraLarge">About Us</div>
        <div class="subTextMedium">Pitching Performance Lab is an indoor baseball facility that specializes in training pitchers. PPL was created with the goal of providing the highest quality information, coaching, and resources to each athlete who comes through the doors. We have worked with pitchers ranging from Little League age all the way up to MLB Pitchers. Our process can be adapted for and applied to pitchers of all ages. </div>

        <div class="headerMedium">Our Process</div>

        <div class="step">
            <div class="stepTopContainer">
                <div class="stepNumber">1</div>
                <div class="stepTitle">Assess</div>
            </div>
            <div class="subTextMedium">We always start with a movement screening, power assessment, delivery analysis, and pitch arsenal breakdown. We want to know why each pitcher moves the way they do. We'll attack things that need to change to positively influence health and performance.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <div class="stepTopContainer">
                <div class="stepNumber">2</div>
                <div class="stepTitle">Program</div>
            </div>
            <div class="subTextMedium">We use the information gathered from the screening to help determine what changes or focus will have the greatest impact on the athlete. The mobility, pre-throwing dynamic exercises, and drill routines will all be tailored to fit their individual needs.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <div class="stepTopContainer">
                <div class="stepNumber">3</div>
                <div class="stepTitle">Coach</div>
            </div>
            <div class="subTextMedium">Our coaches help each athlete work through individualized exercises to elicit positive movement changes. Whether the athlete is working on loading their lower half, fixing timing issues, or developing a new pitch, our coaches have proven time after time that they can work together with athletes to come up with creative solutions and drills to solve problems.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <div class="stepTopContainer">
                <div class="stepNumber">4</div>
                <div class="stepTitle">Re-Assess</div>
            </div>
            <div class="subTextMedium">After a designated period of time, we re-assess focus areas we attack throughout the program to see if our interventions are working. Using objective feedback to inform our decisions, we'll keep going or adjust course if needed. Rinse. Repeat.</div>
