# PPL_Website_Mark_1

Pitching Performance Lab Website Version 1.0

This is a website for a baseball pitching development facility where I've worked in the past. I chose to create this because, even with my limited skillset to create websites at this point, I thought it could provide real value and be useful to the owner of the development facility.

Currently, the PPL wesbite is designed in a way where it needs to be updated all the time with new information, even though the owner of the facility runs everything primarily through social media. The UI also doesn't adapt very well to mobile. Overall, I believe this website I made looks and feels better than the old one.

By making this website, even in this basic form, I'll be able to give PPL a decent-looking, responsive website that requires little to no maintenance, so they can focus on communicating with clients via social media.

I have a list of features to implement in a new version of this site, but I wanted to create something shippable quickly, so I could continue to learn more about web development. Some things I played around with and learned more about during this project.
